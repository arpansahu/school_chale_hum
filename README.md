## What is Python ?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming 
paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

## What is Django ?
Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

## What is Redis ?
    
Redis is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. 
The most common Redis use cases are session cache, full-page cache, queues, leaderboards and counting, publish-subscribe, and much more. in this case, we will use Redis as a message broker.

## What is Ajax?
Ajax is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

## Deployment on AWS EC2/ Home Server Ubuntu 22.0 LTS
Previously This project was hosted on Heroku, but so I started hosting this and all other projects in a 
Single EC2 Machine, which costed me a lot, so now I have shifted all the projects into my own Home Server with 
Ubuntu 22.0 LTS Server, except for portfolio project at https://www.arpansahu.me along with Nginx 


Now there is EC2 server running with a nginx server and arpansahu.me portfolio
Nginx forward https://school-chale-hum.arpansahu.me/ to Home Server 

Multiple Projects are running inside dockers so all projects are dockerized.
You can refer to all projects on https://www.arpansahu.me/projects

Every project have different port on which its running predefined inside Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

![EC2 and Home Server along with Nginx Arrangement](https://github.com/arpansahu/borcelle_crm/blob/master/ec2_and_home_server.png?raw=true)


### Step 1: Dockerizing

Installing Docker on Home Server

Reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

1. Setting up the Repository
   1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS: 
       ```
       sudo apt-get update
    
       sudo apt-get install \
       ca-certificates \
       curl \
       gnupg \
       lsb-release
       ```
   2. Add Docker’s official GPG key:

       ```
       sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    
       curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
       ```

   3. Use the following command to set up the repository:

       ```
       echo \
         "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
         $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
       ```
2. Install Docker Engine
    
   1. Update the apt package index:

      ```
       sudo apt-get update
      ```
    
      1. Receiving a GPG error when running apt-get update?

         Your default umask may be incorrectly configured, preventing detection of the repository public key file. Try granting read permission for the Docker public key file before updating the package index:
            ```
            sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
            sudo apt-get update
            ```
   2. Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.

        ```
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
        ```
   3. Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

        ```
         sudo docker run hello-world
        ```

Now in your Git Repository

Create a file named Dockerfile with no extension and add following lines in it
```
FROM python:3.10.7

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

COPY . .

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8013

CMD python manage.py collectstatic
CMD gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8013 school_chale_hum.wsgi
```

Create a file named docker-compose.yml and add following lines in it

```
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    env_file: ./.env
    command: bash -c "python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8013 school_chale_hum.wsgi"
    image: school_chale_hum
    container_name: school_chale_hum
    volumes:
      - .:/school_chale_hum
    ports:
      - "8013:8013"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### **What is Difference in Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml?**

A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image whereas Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Docker Compose define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment. It gets an app running in one command by just running docker-compose up. Docker compose uses the Dockerfile if you add the build command to your project’s docker-compose.yml. Your Docker workflow should be to build a suitable Dockerfile for each image you wish to create, then use compose to assemble the images using the build command.

Running Docker 
```
docker compose up --build --detach 
```

--detach tag is for running the docker even if terminal is closed
if you remove this tag it will be attached to terminal, and you will be able to see the logs too

--build tag with docker compose up will force image to be rebuild everytime before starting the container

### Step2: Serving the requests from Nginx

Installing Nginx server

```
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Starting Nginx and checking its status 

```
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

#### Modify DNS Configurations

Add these two records to your DNS Configurations
```
A Record	*	0.227.49.244 (public ip of ec2)	Automatic
A Record	@	0.227.49.244 (public ip of ec2)	Automatic
```

Note: now you will be able to see nhinx running page if you open public ip of the machine

Make Sure your EC2 security Group have this entry inbound rules 

```
random-hash-id	IPv4	HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0	–
```

Open a new Nginx Configuration file name can be anything i am choosing arpansahu since my domain is arpansahu.me. there is already a default configuration file but we will leave it like that only

```
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/arpansahu
```

paste this content in the above file

```
server_tokens               off;
access_log                  /var/log/nginx/supersecure.access.log;
error_log                   /var/log/nginx/supersecure.error.log;

server {
  server_name               school-chale-hum.arpansahu.me;        
  listen                    80;
  location / {
    proxy_pass              http://{ip_of_home_server}:8014;
    proxy_set_header        Host $host;
  }
}
```

Basically this single Nginx File will be hosting all the multiple projects which I have listed before also.

Checking if configurations fie is correct

```
sudo service nginx configtest /etc/nginx/sites-available/arpansahu
```

Now you need to symlink this file to the sites-enabled directory:

``` 
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/arpansahu
```

Restarting Nginx Server 
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Now It's time to enable HTTPS for this server

### Step 3: Enabling HTTPS 

1. Base Domain:  Enabling https for base domain only or a single sub domain

    To allow visitors to access your site over HTTPS, you’ll need an SSL/TLS certificate that sits on your web server. Certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority (CA).We’ll use a free CA called Let’s Encrypt. To actually install the certificate, you can use the Certbot client, which gives you an utterly painless step-by-step series of prompts.
    Before starting with Certbot, you can tell Nginx up front to disable TLS version 1.0 and 1.1 in favor of versions 1.2 and 1.3. TLS 1.0 is end-of-life (EOL), while TLS 1.1 contained several vulnerabilities that were fixed by TLS 1.2. To do this, open the file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. Find the following line:
    
    Open nginx.conf file end change ssl_protocols 
    
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    
    From ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; to ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ```
    
    Use this command to verify if nginx.conf file is correct or not
    
    ```
    sudo nginx -t
    ```
    
    Now you’re ready to install and use Certbot, you can use snap to install Certbot:
    
    ```
    sudo snap install --classic certbot
    sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
    ```
    
    Now installing certificate
    
    ```
    sudo certbot --nginx --rsa-key-size 4096 --no-redirect
    ```
    
    It will be asking for domain name then you can enter your base domain 
    I have generated ssl for school-chale-hum.arpansahu.me
    
    Then a few questions will be asked by them answer them all and done your ssl certificate will be geerated
    
    Now These lines will be added to your # Nginx configuration: /etc/nginx/sites-available/arpansahu
    
    ```
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.supersecure.codes/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.supersecure.codes/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
    ```
    
    Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS
    Open nginx configuration file  and make it like this

    ```
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/arpansahu
    ```
    ```
    server_tokens               off;
    access_log                  /var/log/nginx/supersecure.access.log;
    error_log                   /var/log/nginx/supersecure.error.log;
     
    server {
      server_name               school-chale-hum.arpansahu.me;
      listen                    80;
      return                    307 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
    
    server {
    
      location / {
        proxy_pass              http://{ip_of_home_server}:8014;
        proxy_set_header        Host $host;
        
        listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
    }                          
    ``` 
    
    You can dry run and check weather it's renewal is working or not
    ```
    sudo certbot renew --dry-run
    ```
    
    Note: this process was for borcelle-crm.arpansahu.me and not for all subdomains.
        For all subdomains we will have to setup a wildcard ssl certificate


2. Enabling a Wildcard certificate

    Here we will enable ssl certificate for all subdomains at once
    
    Run following Command
    ```
    sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns
    ```
    
    Again you will be asked domain name and here you will use *.arpansahu.me. and second domain you will use is
    arpansahu.me.
    
    Now, you should be having a question in your mind that why we are generating ssl for arpansahu.me separately.
    It's because Let's Encrupt does not include base doamin with wildcard certificates for subdomains.

    After running above command you will see a message similar to this
    
    ```
    Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
    Please enter the domain name(s) you would like on your certificate (comma and/or
    space separated) (Enter 'c' to cancel): *.arpansahu.me
    Requesting a certificate for *.arpansahu.me
    
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:
    
    _acme-challenge.arpansahu.me.
    
    with the following value:
    
    dpWCxvq3mARF5iGzSfaRNXwmdkUSs0wgsTPhSaX1gK4
    
    Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
    provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
    check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
    Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.arpansahu.me.
    Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
    value(s) you've just added.
   
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Press Enter to Continue
    ```
   
    You will be given a dns challenge called ACME challenger you have to create a dns TXT record in DNS.
    Similar to below record.
    
    ```
    TXT Record	_acme-challenge	dpWCxvq3mARF5iGzSfaRNXwmdkUSs0wgsTPhSaX1gK4	5 Automatic
    ```
    
    Now, use this url to verify records are updated or not

    https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.arpansahu.me (arpansahu.me is domain)

    If its verified then press enter the terminal as mentioned above
    
    Then your certificate will be generated
    ```
    Successfully received certificate.
    Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me-0001/fullchain.pem            (use this in your nginx configuration file)
    Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me-0001/privkey.pem
    This certificate expires on 2023-01-20.
    These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
    ```
    
    You can notice here, certificate generated is arpansahu.me-0001 and not arpansahu.me
    because we already generated a certificate named arpansahu.me
    
    So remember to delete it before generating this wildcard certificate
    using command

    ```
    sudo certbot delete
    ```
    
    Note: This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Auto-renewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.

3. Generating Wildcard SSL certificate and Automating its renewal

    1. Modify your ec2 inbound rules 
    
      ```
      –	sgr-0219f1387d28c96fb	IPv4	DNS (TCP)	TCP	53	0.0.0.0/0	–	
      –	sgr-01b2b32c3cee53aa9	IPv4	SSH	TCP	22	0.0.0.0/0	–
      –	sgr-0dfd03bbcdf60a4f7	IPv4	HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0	–
      –	sgr-02668dff944b9b87f	IPv4	HTTPS	TCP	443	0.0.0.0/0	–
      –	sgr-013f089a3f960913c	IPv4	DNS (UDP)	UDP	53	0.0.0.0/0	–
      ```
    
   2. Install acme-dns Server

      * Create folder for acme-dns and change directory

        ```
         sudo mkdir /opt/acme-dns
         cd !$
        ```
      * Download and extract tar with acme-dns from GitHub

        ```
        sudo curl -L -o acme-dns.tar.gz \
        https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns/releases/download/v0.8/acme-dns_0.8_linux_amd64.tar.gz
        sudo tar -zxf acme-dns.tar.gz
        ```
      * List files
        ```
        sudo ls
        ```
      * Clean Up
        ```

      * Move the systemd service and reload
        ```
        cat acme-dns.service
     
        sudo mv \
        acme-dns.service /etc/systemd/system/acme-dns.service
	  
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        ```
      * Start and enable acme-dns server
        ```
        sudo systemctl enable acme-dns.service
        sudo systemctl start acme-dns.service
        ```
      * Check acme-dns for posible errors

        auth.arpansahu.me IN NS auth.arpansahu.me
        ```
      * Your DNS record will be looking like this
        ```
        A Record	auth	44.199.177.138	Automatic	
        NS Record	auth	auth.arpansahu.me.	Automatic
        ```
      * Test acme-dns server (Split the screen)
        ```
        journalctl -u acme-dns --no-pager --follow
        ```
      * From local host try to resolve random DNS record
        ```
        dig api.arpansahu.me
        dig api.auth.arpansahu.me
        dig 7gvhsbvf.auth.arpansahu.me
        ``` 
        
   3. Install acme-dns-client 
     ```
     sudo mkdir /opt/acme-dns-client
     cd !$
    
     sudo curl -L \
     -o acme-dns-client.tar.gz \
     https://github.com/acme-dns/acme-dns-client/releases/download/v0.2/acme-dns-client_0.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    
     sudo tar -zxf acme-dns-client.tar.gz
     ls
     sudo rm acme-dns-client.tar.gz
     sudo ln -s \
     /opt/acme-dns-client/acme-dns-client /usr/local/bin/acme-dns-client 
     ```
   4. Install Certbot
     ```
     cd
     sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
     sudo snap install --classic certbot
     sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
     ```
    Note: you can skip step4 if Certbot is already installed

    5. Get Letsencrypt Wildcard Certificate
       * Create a new acme-dns account for your domain and set it up
         ```
         sudo acme-dns-client register \
         -d arpansahu.me -s http://localhost:8090
         ```
         Note: When we edited acme-dns config file there we mentioned the port 8090 and thats why we are using this port here also
       * Creating Another DNS Entry 
         ```
         CNAME Record	_acme-challenge	e6ac0f0a-0358-46d6-a9d3-8dd41f44c7ec.auth.arpansahu.me.	Automatic
         ```
         Same as an entry is needed to be added to complete one time challenge as in previously we did.
       * Check the entry is added successfully or not
         ```
         dig _acme-challenge.arpansahu.me
         ```
       * Get wildcard certificate
         ```
         sudo certbot certonly \
         --manual \
         --test-cert \ 
         --preferred-challenges dns \ 
         --manual-auth-hook 'acme-dns-client' \ 
         -d ‘*.arpansahu.me’ -d arpansahu.me
         ```
         Note: Here we have to mention both the base and wildcard domain names with -d since let's encrypt don't provide base domain ssl by default in wildcard domain ssl
       *Verifying the certificate
         ```
         sudo openssl x509 -text -noout \
         -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me/fullchain.pem
         ```
       * Renew certificate (test)
         ```
         sudo certbot renew \
         --manual \ 
         --test-cert \ 
         --dry-run \ 
         --preferred-challenges dns \
         --manual-auth-hook 'acme-dns-client'       
         ```
       * Renew certificate (actually)
         ```
         sudo certbot renew \
         --manual \
         --preferred-challenges dns \
         --manual-auth-hook 'acme-dns-client'       
         ```
       * Check the entry is added successfully or not
         ```
         dig _acme-challenge.arpansahu.me
         ```
    6. Setup Auto-Renew for Letsencrypt WILDCARD Certificate
       * Setup cronjob
         ```
         sudo crontab -e
         ```
       * Add following lines to the file
         ```
         0 */12 * * * certbot renew --manual --test-cert --preferred-challenges dns --manual-auth-hook 'acme-dns-client'
         ```

After all these steps your Nginx configuration file located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/arpansahu will be looking similar to this

```
server_tokens               off;
access_log                  /var/log/nginx/supersecure.access.log;
error_log                   /var/log/nginx/supersecure.error.log;

server {
    listen         80;
    server_name    school-chale-hum.arpansahu.me;
    # force https-redirects
    if ($scheme = http) {
        return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
        }

    location / {
         proxy_pass              http://{ip_of_home_server}:8014;
         proxy_set_header        Host $host;
         proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

	 # WebSocket support
         proxy_http_version 1.1;
         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
         proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
   
	

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```

### Step 4: CI/CD using Jenkins

Installing Jenkins

Reference: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/

Jenkins requires Java in order to run, yet certain distributions don’t include this by default and some Java versions are incompatible with Jenkins.

There are multiple Java implementations which you can use. OpenJDK is the most popular one at the moment, we will use it in this guide.

Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 11, and check the installation with the commands:

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre

java -version
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Long Term Support release

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

Start Jenkins

```
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

You can start the Jenkins service with the command:

```
sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:
```
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

Now for serving the Jenkins UI from Nginx add these following lines to the Nginx file located at 
/etc/nginx/sites-available/arpansahu by running the following command

```
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/arpansahu
```

* Add these lines to it.

    ```
    server {
        listen         80;
        server_name    jenkins.arpansahu.me;
        # force https-redirects
        if ($scheme = http) {
            return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
            }
    
        location / {
             proxy_pass              http://{ip_of_home_server}:8080;
             proxy_set_header        Host $host;
             proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    
        listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/arpansahu.me/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
    }
    ```

You can add all the server blocks to the same nginx configuration file
just make sure you place the server block for base domain at the last

* To copy .env from local server directory while buidling image

add Jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
inside /etc/sudoers file

and then put 

stage('Dependencies') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh "sudo cp /root/env/project_name/.env /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/project_name"
                }
            }
        }

in jenkinsfile

* Now Create a file named Jenkinsfile at the root of Git Repo and add following lines to file

```
pipeline {
    agent { label 'local' }
    stages {
        stage('Dependencies') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh "sudo cp /root/projectenvs/school_chale_hum/.env /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/school_chale_hum"
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Production') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh "docker compose up --build --detach"
                }
            }
        }
    }

```

Note: agent {label 'local'} is used to specify which node will execute the jenkins job deployment. Basically there are two nodes in this project 
      One is my local Linux Server and Another is AWS EC2 machine where nginx is hosted there arpansahu.me my portfolio is also hosted is also hosted.
      So local linux server is labelled with 'local' are the project with this label will be executed in local machine node.


* Configure a Jenkins project from jenkins ui located at https://jenkins.arpansahu.me

Make sure to use Pipline project and name it whatever you want I have named it as school_chale_hum

![Jenkins Project for borcelle CRM Configuration File](/school_chale_hum-Config-Jenkins-.png)

In this above picture you can see credentials right? you can add your github credentials
from Manage Jenkins on home Page --> Manage Credentials

and add your GitHub credentials from there

* Add a .env file to you project using following command (This step is no more required stage('Dependencies'))

    ```
    sudo vi  /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/borcelle_crm_declarative_pipeline_project/.env
    ```

    Your workspace name may be different.

    Add all the env variables as required and mentioned in the Readme File.

* Add Global Jenkins Variables from Dashboard --> Manage --> Jenkins
  Configure System
 
  * MAIL_JET_API_KEY
  * MAIL_JET_API_SECRET
  * MAIL_JET_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  * MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS

Now you are good to go.
